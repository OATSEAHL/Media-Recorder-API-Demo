# Media Recorder API Demo

This Teacher Virus payload was created from a fork of the original Media Recorder API Demo as seen here:
https://github.com/nusofthq/Media-Recorder-API-Demo 

Which provided a demo implementation of the (new) [Media Recorder API](http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-record/MediaRecorder.html) (also known as MediaStream Recording API).

This version was created so that we could experiment with Video recording and it's integration into Teacher Virus and the ability to add content directly into the TV Player library for immediate access by students connecting to a TV server (hotspot school)
